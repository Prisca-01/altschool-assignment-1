        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>I'm Onyemaechi Chinetam Prisca, a passionate female student pursuing dual degrees—a third-year student in
            Medical Laboratory Sciences at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and a Frontend Engineering student at
            AltSchool Africa. I am from Anambra state, Nigeria. At the age of nineteen, I stand at the intersection of
            medicine and technology, driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact in both fields. I come from a family
            that values perseverance and education. Growing up in a modest neighbourhood, my parents worked tirelessly
            to support my siblings and me. Their unwavering support and belief in the power of education have been the
            basic part of my journey.
        </p>
        <p>My educational journey has been marked by a relentless quest to learn and know more. I attended Federal
            Government Girls’ College, Onitsha, Anambra state, Nigeria where I embraced the opportunities for academic
            growth. During my secondary school years, I consistently strived for excellence and earned recognitions for
            my dedication to my studies.</p>

           <p> My extracurricular activities also played huge roles in shaping my educational journey. I love reading and
            surfing the net, which allowed me to learn and collaborate with like-minded peers. In addition to my
            academic pursuits, I enjoy cooking, which has not only provided a creative outlet but also taught me
            valuable skills in organization and time management, and I also cherish moments of relaxation and
            restorative sleep.</p>
